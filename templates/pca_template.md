# P-C-A Prompt Template

This template structures reasoning into three phases to encourage self-refinement: Propose, Critique, and Act.

## Sections

1. **Propose** – Provide an initial answer or plan without worrying about flaws. Write a clear proposal.
2. **Critique** – Identify weaknesses, missing assumptions, or potential improvements in the proposal.
3. **Act** – Revise the proposal based on the critique and present the final answer.

Use this format in prompts to encourage iterative improvement.
