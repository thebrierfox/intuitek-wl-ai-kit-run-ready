## P-C-A Prompt Template (`templates/pca_template.md`)

A three-phase template that guides a model through **Propose**, **Critique**, and **Act** steps to iteratively improve its answers:

1. **Propose** – Write an initial answer or plan without worrying about flaws.
2. **Critique** – Analyze the proposal's strengths, weaknesses, and missing assumptions.
3. **Act** – Revise and deliver the final answer based on the critique.

Use this template to structure prompts that require self-reflection and refinement.
