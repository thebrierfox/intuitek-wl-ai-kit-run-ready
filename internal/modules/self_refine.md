**Category:** Reasoning

**Reason for use:** Iteratively improves an initial answer by refining it based on evaluation of quality criteria.

**Theoretical basis:** Self-refinement strategies leverage meta-cognition to improve answer quality and reduce hallucination.

**Prompt trigger:** Include the phrase “self-refine” in the plan or user instructions to enable this module.

**Expected behaviour:** Takes a draft answer and iteratively refines it until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

**Trace label:** self_refine
