# Resource Impact Estimator Module

**Category:** Estimation

**Reason for use:** Estimates the computational resources (CPU time, memory) and environmental impact (e.g., energy usage, carbon footprint) associated with running a particular chain of modules or actions.

**Theoretical basis:** Provides transparency into the approximate resource consumption of AI tasks, enabling more sustainable and cost-efficient decisions.

**Prompt trigger:** Include “resource impact estimator” in the plan or ask for impact estimation to enable this module.

**Expected behaviour:** Takes a description of planned module executions or code snippets and returns estimated runtime, memory usage, and CO₂ equivalent emissions.

**Trace label:** resource_impact_estimator
